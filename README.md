* Since this code was written over a 2 years ago I am not sure if this code still works as is. If you want to use this code just double check that the classes that the bot scrapes from instagrams website are still the same. * 


# A_Perfect_User
My Harvard CS50 final project. 

"A Perfect User" is a full featured bot that behaves like what I believe the ideal instagram user would. This python program logs into instagram and performs tasks such as:
 - Follow users.
 - Like an image randomly between every 1 to 10 hours.
 - Save the top image from reddit.com/r/pics along with the description and user who posted it. Then posts it to instagram (crediting the user of course!). This program does this every two days.

### Running this program
To run this program type: `python3 application.py` and type your instagram username and password into your terminal. You can also easily make changes in the `main()` function in `application.py` to change the frequency that the bot performs its tasks. in the background of your computer

### What makes this IG bot different from other Instagram bots?
This bot was not made to gain followers or likes but just behave like a normal person on Instagram. I also believe this bot to be the first ever made that is 100% Python/Selenium. The challenge is when uploading photos, all other bots seem to use AutoIt to handle the pop up window. But I was able to find a way to do it with just Selenium.
